# Spring Boot Project

This project is developed with **Spring Boot**, following the "In Action" book series to deepen the knowledge of the framework and its tools.

## ðŸ“š Based on the "In Action" Series
This repository follows best practices and concepts explained in the following books:
- **Spring in Action** by Craig Walls
- **Spring Security in Action** by Laurentiu Spilca
- **Spring Boot in Action** by Craig Walls
- **Spring Microservices in Action** by John Carnell

## ðŸš€ Dependencies
- **Spring Boot** (Main framework)
- **Spring Security** (Authentication and authorization)
- **Spring Data JPA** (Persistence with Hibernate and relational databases)
- **Spring Web** (REST API development)
- **Thymeleaf** (Server-side rendering, optional)
- **Lombok** (Reducing repetitive code)
- **H2 Database / MySQL / PostgreSQL** (In-memory or relational databases)
- **Spring Boot DevTools** (Hot reload for rapid development)
- **Spring Cloud** (Microservices architecture)
- **Spring Cloud Config** (Centralized configuration management for microservices)
- **Spring Cloud Netflix** (Service discovery, load balancing, etc.)
- **Spring Boot Actuator** (Application monitoring and management)

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites
To run the project, you need:
- **Java 17 or higher**
- **Maven or Gradle**
- **Spring Boot 3.x**

## ðŸ›  Installation and Execution
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
